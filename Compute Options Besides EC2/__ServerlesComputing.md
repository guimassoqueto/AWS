## Serverless computing

As you learned about Amazon EC2, a service that lets you run virtual servers in the cloud. If you have applications that you want to run in Amazon EC2, you must do the following:  

1. Provision instances (virtual servers).
2. Upload your code.
3. Continue to manage the instances while your application is running.

Illustration comparing computing with virtual servers (thinking about servers and code) and serverless computing (thinking only about code).  

The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.  

Another benefit of serverless computing is the flexibility to scale serverless applications automatically. Serverless computing can adjust the applications' capacity by modifying the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory.
